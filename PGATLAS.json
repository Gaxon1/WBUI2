October 8: Noticed a bug with the Ship Resource + box. The contents will occasionally be invisible, relog to fix the issue.
October 9: Treasure Map Bottles are fixed.
October 11: Servers ending in 1, 2 & 3 have been moved to a second box. Hopefully this will prevent lag spikes and out of memory crashes. The Database has been moved to a 3rd box by itself.
October 11: Found that the Atlas Plus 7 mod has some game breaking bugs. We apologize for the inconvenience and loss of any structures affected by this. Added Better Farms 2.
October 12: Wiped servers and database due to bugs caused by a bad mod. All good now, please report any bugs or issues on Discord.",
